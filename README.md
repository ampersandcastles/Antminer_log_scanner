If youre reading this right now it is not currently funtional, i just started today and finished it after I left, I will test it in the morning tomorrow.

This is a simple program to search Bitmains Antminer s19 series, s19j series, and s19k series miners and their different hashrate and pro variants. THIS ONLY WORKS ON STOCK FIRMWARE FOR NOW, IF YOU'RE ON BRAIINS, VNISH, OR LUXOS THIS WILL NOT WORK FOR NOW ATLEAST. I've been making this to make my job consist less of looking through endless logs trying to see why this particular miner won't work again. If you happen to stumble across this and mine bitcoin with antminers, you're welcome :)

To use it just run the miner_scan.exe, enter your miners ipv4 address and enter your miners ssh password (by default its miner so if you dont know it then its most likely that) and it will spit out the error messages it found in the logs.
